About me
======
I am currently studying a bachelorâ€™s program in Information Systems with a specialization in System Development while also working part time as an assistant for the courses in the program. I have a great interest in programming, primarily backend development with a focus on functionality and code structure. I enjoy working in team environments and often take on leadership roles. I find it rewarding to mentor and support colleagues, contributing to their success and growth. Additionally, I am actively involved in the IT-committee of the Uppsala Systemvetare association, where I have both the role as Vice Chairman and as a software developer.
